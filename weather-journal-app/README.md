Weather Journal App
Description

The Weather Journal App is a web-based project that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on a user's input (zip code). It allows users to log their feelings alongside the current weather conditions for the entered location. The app demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript, API handling, and dynamically updating the DOM.

## Features
- Fetch current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-entered zip code.
- Allow users to enter their thoughts or feelings about the weather.
- Store weather and user data on a server.
- Dynamically update the UI with the fetched weather data and user input.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
- Body-Parser: Middleware to parse request bodies.
- Cors: Middleware for handling cross-origin requests.
- Fetch API: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
